            <h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
            <p> Underscores, otherwise known as Devon Karpf, is a hyperpop artist from San Francisco who got their start
                on SoundCloud. <em>Fishmonger</em> is their 2021 debut album which contains 10 tracks including "Your favorite sidekick".
            </p>

            <h2>ABOUT</h2>
            <p>"Your favorite sidekick" stands out to me particularly because of how well it combines a playful melody with visceral intrumentals.
                As a whole though, the song definitely embodies the aesthetics of angsty teenagers doing angsty teenager things. 
                Throughout the track, you get the occasional punk guitar section but more importantly, a routine bass that is almost deafening.
                As surprising as it is at first, over time the bass became one of my favorite aspects of the song. 
                It adds a sense of satisfaction everytime it plays after a verse. </p>
