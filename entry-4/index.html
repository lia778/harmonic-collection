        <h2>THOUGHTS</h2>
        <p>
        Outside of the band Dios, this single is one of the very few songs with Ichika Nito performing alonside a vocalist.
        Ichika is a well-known guitarist with a unique style of playing and guitar tone but almost always plays solo.
        In "By Your Side" Gengar Musique lends his voice in addition to a backing track to create an emotional and uplifting
        track. Though the lyrics are repetitive and the vocals only appear during the chorus, it doesn't bother me very much
        as there is so much variety throughout the song and even a few guitar solos.
