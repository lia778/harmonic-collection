                Met her at a party, said, "She seems nice"
                <br>
                Never thought she
                <br>
                Met her at a party, I said, "She seems nice"
                <br>
                Every time I thought about it, I got butterflies
                <br>
                And when I told you we agree that she's alright (ah)
                <br>
                Never thought I'd be trippin' over the lost time
                <br>
                I said it was fine, yeah
                <br>
                Layin' down, six feet under, it's sublime
                <br>
                Shoulda saw the signs, now we're in a fight (ah)
                </p>
                I don't know
                <br>
                How I can forgive you
                </p>
                It's all in my mind, it's all in my mind
                <br>
                I try to rewind and all of the while
                <br>
                I'm hurtin' inside, it's your fault
                <br>
                Maybe it's my fault
                <br>
                It's all in my mind, it's all in my mind

                Said, "I could handle this"
                <br>
                That was your one request
                <br>
                Said I would be there, be there in your distress
                <br>
                Instead, you just feel dispensed
                </p>
                I don't know
                <br>
                If I'm worth forgiving
                </p>

          <h2>ABOUT</h2>
          <p>
          As someone who's been following WILLOW for a while now, I think it's safe to say that she's been a pioneer in 
          in the recent resurgence of pop punk. Though her music has always been quite experimental, it wasn't until
          her single "t r a n s p a r e n t s o u l" that she started shifting her sound towards punk. To me, "&ltmaybe&gt it's my fault"
          captures the same magic that "t r a n s p a r e n t s o u l" did. "&ltmaybe&gt it's my fault" is definitely
          the more aggresive sounding of the two and embodies a violent yet depressive tone. This is obvious in the 
          breakdowns in the song, characterized by the low-tuned guitar and the distortion filter on WILLOW's voice.
          And immediately after, the chorus takes over with WILLOW singing angelically until she slowly transitions 
          to a wallow at the end of the verse. As much as I like this pre-chorus and chorus though, it unfortunately
          plays too many times throughout the song even though it's only a little over 2 minutes long.
