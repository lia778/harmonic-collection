          Tell the men I'm coming
          <br>
          Tell them count the days
          <br>
          I can feel the night passing by like a mistake waiting for me
          <br>
          Caught up in my feelings
          <br>
          Overthink the truth
          <br>
          Fantasize you've left me behind and I'm turned back running for you
          </p>
          Make it up to me, you know it's better
          <br>
          Make it up to me, you know it's better
          </p>
          Be sweet to me, baby
          <br>
          I wanna believe in you, I wanna believe
          <br>
          (Be sweet)
          <br>
          Be sweet to me, baby
          <br>
          I wanna believe in you, I wanna believе in something
          </p>
          So come and get your woman (Comе and get your woman)
          <br>
          Pacify her rage (Pacify her rage)
          <br>
          Take the time to undo your lies, make it up once more with feeling
          <br>
          Recognize your mistakes and I'll let you back in
          <br>
          Realize not too late, loved you always
          </p>
          Make it up to me, you know it's better
          <br>
          Make it up to me, you know it's better

          Be sweet to me, baby
          <br>
          I wanna believe in you, I wanna believе 
          <br>
          (Be sweet)

        <h2>ABOUT</h2>
        <p>
          Back in 2018, I decided to try out writing sessions for the first time, and I was having a tough go of it. My publisher had set me up with Jack Tatum of Wild Nothing. What happens is they lie to you and say, ‘Jack loves your music and wants you to help him write his new record!’ And to him they’d say, ‘Michelle loves Wild Nothing, she wants to write together!’ Once we got together we were like, ‘I don’t need help. I’m not writing a record.’ So we decided we’d just write a pop song to sell and make some money. We didn’t have anyone specific in mind, we just knew it wasn’t going to be for either of us. Of course, once we started putting it together, I realised I really loved it. I think the distance of writing it for ‘someone else’ allowed me to take on this sassy ‘80s women-of-the-night persona. To me, it almost feels like a Madonna, Whitney Houston or Janet Jackson song.        </p>
