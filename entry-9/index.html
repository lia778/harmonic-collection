        <h2>ABOUT</h2>
        <p>With a “corso” being a social promenade or walkway where events and festivals often happen, this song is about Tyler’s social life and influence on people around him. More importantly, this is the first mention of his “entanglement” with his friend’s girl on the album.

            “CORSO” is the introduction to the plot that we will later go through as the album progresses. Tyler has done this on multiple occasion in his discography such as “WOLF” from Wolf, in which we are introduced rather abruptly to the characters whose story will play out over the course of the album.
            
            The song title could also mean that Tyler dropping an album is a festivity in itself, since it is the first major song on CALL ME IF YOU GET LOST.
            
            According to Tyler, this song was also originally going to feature A$AP Rocky, an artist he often has collaborated with in the past. Unfortunately, he never responded to the request.</p>
