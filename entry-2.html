                    <br>
                    Can't sleep, 2 a.m., I don't really mind it
                    <br>
                    Ring ring, pick it up, I could be your sidekick
                    <br>
                    (I'm your favorite sidekick)
                    <br>
                    Fake smile, run it back, guess I've never tried it
                    <br>
                    OC, double dose, off the psilocybin
                    <br>

                    All dressed up, nowhere to be, ever
                    <br>
                    I could rot, let's do it together
                    <br>
                    (Hey, what's up?)
                    <br>
                    Voicemail, think you're so clever
                    <br>
                    Shut up, come on (yeah, it's now or never)
                    </p>
                    Black Docs, white socks, 2014 clich√©
                    <br>
                    I'm bored, aux cord, let me be the DJ
                    <br>
                    We're so right 'bout everything that we say
                    <br>
                    We're so cool (bratmobile on the B-way)
                    <br>
                    (Best friend ever)
                    </p>
                    And I've been eating toothpaste
                    <br>
                    'Cause you gave me toothaches
                    <br>
                    And this could go two ways now
                    <br>
                    I think you drank my kool-aid
                    <br>
                    And I've been up for two days
                    <br>
                    Why are the things that you say always in my mouth? (Uh-oh)

                    I can feel pain all around me
                    <br>
                    But I know it's never gonna be mine
                    <br>
                    Pick a date and we can kill some
                    <br>
                    Pick a date and we can kill some time
                    <br>
                    You can find me in the middle of nowhere
                    <br>
                    Everybody's dying but I guess it's alright
                    <br>
                    I told you everything was gonna be
                    <br>
                    I told you everything was gonna be fine
