            <p>Face away
                <br>
                Deal with the pain
                <br>
                Your own way
                <br>
                How could they deal with the pain?
                </p>
                I knew
                <br>
                That it was mine too
                <br>
                And you?
                <br>    
                Is it really you?
                </p>
                Let's search the sky for a while
                <br>
                You and I
                <br>
                Collide like two stars for a while
                <br>
                You and I
                </p>
                Crushed by silent snow
                <br>
                Not the first I know
                <br>
                Caught in ebb and flow
                <br>
                I'm bleeding out, oh you know
                </p>
                Is it really you?
                <br>
                Let's search the sky for a while
                <br>
                You and I
                <br>
                Collide like two stars for a while
                <br>
                You and I</p>

<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
<p>Loathe are a heavy metal band based in Liverpool. "Is It Really You?" is currently their most popular song from their 2020 album <em>I Let It in and It Took Everything</em>.</p>

<h2>THOUGHTS</h2>
<p>As someone who has been getting more into rock and metal music this year, I can see why this song in particular is so popular. 
    It definitely embodies a more pop-like sound compared to the rest of the songs in the album, especially in the chorus, but I believe there are a lot of elements that more die-hard metal fans can enjoy.
    I appreciated the difference in energy the vocals had in and out of the chorus; during the verses and pre-chorus they're very breathy and depressing, but when the chorus hits they become desperate and screams of helplessness.
    I also found the punchiness of the drums very satisfying. I feel that if they weren't as upfront, it would diminish the impact of the transitions during the intro and chorus.
    At 4 minutes and 48 seconds, the song is on the lengthier side but it's paced wonderfully and has some distinct phases that make it hard to experience any sort of fatigue.
    To be honest, this song makes me feel obligated to just stop whatever I'm doing, close my eyes, and just listen to it. It just has a very somber atmosphere that conveys feelings of longing but also reunion.</p>
