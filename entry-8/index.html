          </p>
          날 선 길을 우리 걸어온 듯해
          <br>
          발밑 언저리가 닳아 없어지면
          <br>
          자라나기를 반복하는 게
          <br>
          숨이 멎을 때쯤엔 걸음을 멈출까
          <br>
          되돌아갈 곳도 이젠 흐려져
          <br>
          앞으로 가다 보면 뭔가 볼 수 있나
          <br>
          사실 그게 뭔지 기대도 없어
          </p>
          Ooh, nouvelle vague
          <br>
          It's so far away from me
          <br>
          Oh, don't fade away nouvelle vague
          <br>
          'Cause we want to get close to you
          </p>
          음 아무래도 우린 망가진 거야
          <br>
          어찌해야 해 네 기댈 망치고
          <br>
          자라나길 반복할 수 있을까
          <br>
          숨이 멎을 때쯤엔 걸음을 멈출까
          <br>
          되돌아갈 곳도 이젠 흐려져
          <br>
          앞으로 가다 보면 뭔가 볼 수 있나
          <br>
          사실 그게 뭔지 기대도 없어
          </p>
          Ooh, nouvelle vague
          <br>
          It's so far away from me

          </p>
          It seems like we have been on this sharp road before
          <br>
          If the soles of your feet are worn out
          <br>
          You'll grow all over again
          </p>
          Will my footsteps stop by the time I'm out of breath?
          <br>
          The place to go back is fogged up now
          <br>
          If we go forward, would there be something to see?
          <br>
          I really have no expectations, yeah
          </p>
          Ooh, nouvelle vague
          <br>
          It's so far away from me
          <br>
          Oh, don't fade away nouvelle vague
          <br>
          'Cause we want to get close to you
          </p>
          Mm, we're probably going to be destroyеd
          <br>
          How do I crush your expectations?
          <br>
          Can I renеw my growth?
          </p>
          Will my footsteps stop by the time I'm out of breath?
          <br>
          The place to go back is fogged up now

          I really have no expectations, yeah
