          </p>
          Swear I couldn't sleep a wink last night
          <br>
          No point in turning off the lights
          <br>
          Not the same without your head on my shoulders
          <br>
          Growing pains, but I don't wanna get older
          <br>
          Almost like we left it all on read
          <br>
          Couple feelings never laid to rest
          <br>
          Didn't know that the party was over
          <br>
          And it's true that I need you here closer
          </p>
          Burning photos
          <br>
          Had to learn to let go
          <br>
          I used to be
          <br>
          Somebody in another skin (Another skin)
          </p>
          I heard that you're happy without me
          <br>
          And I hope it's true (I hope, I hope it's true)
          <br>
          It kills me a little, that's okay
          <br>
          'Cause I'd die for you
          <br>
          You know I'd still die for you
          </p>
          I hopе you're getting evеrything you needed
          <br>
          Found the puzzle piece and feel completed
          <br>
          Just wanted you to know every reason
          <br>
          Hope you really know that I mean that
          <br>
          I couldn't see the forest from the trees
          <br>
          Only time we speak is in my dreams
          </p>

        <h2>ABOUT</h2>
        <p>“Die For You” is the third track off Joji’s third studio album SMITHEREENS. The track sees Joji post-breakup from a past relationship and claiming that' he hopes his lover is getting everything that he couldn’t provide for while at the same time showing his love for her while saying “I’d still die for you”.

            The song’s title is notable as the 10th track (R.I.P) off Joji’s debut album BALLADS 1 has a chorus that features the line “I would die for you” being repeated several times.
            
            The song’s existence dates back to August 9, 2022, when fans discovered the song being registered through ASCAP prompting fans to suspect the song as an upcoming song off an (at the time) unknown project.
            
            On August 28, 2022, two days after Joji announced the release date for his third studio album ‘'SMITHEREENS’‘, the albums Apple Music page would list the credits of the album’s third song with the same credits as found on ASCAP confirming that the suspected song would be releasing.
            
            On October 14, 2022, the track is revealed alongside the rest of the tracklist through Deezer and was finally confirmed with certainty as the third track off the album. It is then teased in a 20-second social media post announcing the official tracklist for SMITHEREENS. This snippet would be confirmed as Die For You by the song co-writer and co-producer Tay Dex on Twitter.</p>
